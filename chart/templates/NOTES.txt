Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}

Your cloud SSH server has started!

Add the following line to your `known_hosts` file to automatically trust servers with your CA key:

    @cert-authority * {{ .Values.ssh.ca_key_pub }}

This is your host configuration: 

{{ .Values.rcEnv | nindent 4 }}

If you did not specify an SSH public key in the DEFAULT_KEY variable, or a LaunchPad or GitHub 
account in the DEFAULT_KEY_IMPORT variable, you will not be able to login using SSH. 

**DO NOT USE THE DEFAULT SSH CA KEY IN PRODUCTION** 

You should generate your own keys by running `make`.
